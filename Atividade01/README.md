# Atividade01

For this assignment, I wrote a function to manage saving images on the disk. I chose primarily PNG encoding when dealing with images, thus using the `libpng` library. To test the save function, I represented some images in a 2D array of 256x256 and used the function `save_image()` to save them into .png files. 

> A load function is yet to be written for use on future assignments.
